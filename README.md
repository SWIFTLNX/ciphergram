# ciphergram
Ciphergram is a secure, ephemeral chat platform that uses end‑to‑end encryption and randomized alphabets derived per session. Users join rooms with a shared code, exchange ciphertext relayed only by the server, and view messages rendered in unique symbol mappings. All keys, mappings, and history are wiped when the chat ends.
